                    Who am I?
                    Am I not unique?
                    Maybe I'm not here at all
                    Look, the fakers  
                    Blinding us with lies  
                    To break us all  
                    Oh, it's useless  
                    What could it mean that we're here?  
                    (What does is it mean)  
                    Can we make a difference  
                    (Can we make a deep difference)  
                    If we don't break outta here?  
                    Wake up, get up, get out there  
                    Raise your voice against liars  
                    Feed your anger like fire  
                    Why does nobody want change?  
                    Just imagine you're out there  
                    Swatting lies in the making  
                    Can't move fast without breaking  
                    If you hold on life won't change  
                    Huh  
                    Are you ready?  
                    Ready to pick up a pursuit?  
                    "Let's go"  
                    "Let's wait"  
                    Retaliate  
                    I say  
                    Are you ready?  
                    Huh-huh  
                    Make a brake make a switch  
                    It's a free dance  
                    Free dance  
                    We gonna brake you down  
                    Are you ready?  
                    The fakers  
                    Are all sick at heart  
                    Their faces hiding their fear  
                    They look down on  
                    All the rest of us  
                    Like they're some special breed  
                    Who's the high lord  
                    Who thinks he's better than us?  
                    Ain't it a crime, that?  
                    Is there a mission for us?  
                    Who is that high lord?  
                    Who'd kill a million of us?  
                    And as the bell tolls  
                    Is there no remission for us?  
                    Wake up, get up, get out there  
                    There's more to life than their way  
                    If you'd live you cannot stay  
                    Why does nobody want change?  
                    Let your voices ring out, yeah  
                    Take the mask off and be free  
                    Find yourself in the debris  
                    If you hold on life won't change  
                    Wake up, get up, get out there  
                    Raise your voice against liars  
                    Feed your anger like fire  
                    Why does nobody want change?  
                    Just imagine you're out there  
                    Swatting lies in the making  
                    Can't move fast without breaking  
                    If you hold on life won't change
