                <p>
                    Who am I? <br>
                    Am I not unique? <br>
                    Maybe I'm not here at all <br>
                    Look, the fakers <br>
                    Blinding us with lies <br>
                    To break us all <br>
                    Oh, it's useless <br>
                    What could it mean that we're here? <br>
                    (What does is it mean) <br>
                    Can we make a difference <br>
                    (Can we make a deep difference) <br>
                    If we don't break outta here? <br>
                    Wake up, get up, get out there <br>
                    Raise your voice against liars <br>
                    Feed your anger like fire <br>
                    Why does nobody want change? <br>
                    Just imagine you're out there <br>
                    Swatting lies in the making <br>
                    Can't move fast without breaking <br>
                    If you hold on life won't change <br>
                    Huh <br>
                    Are you ready? <br>
                    Ready to pick up a pursuit? <br>
                    "Let's go" <br>
                    "Let's wait" <br>
                    Retaliate <br>
                    I say <br>
                    Are you ready? <br>
                    Huh-huh <br>
                    Make a brake make a switch <br>
                    It's a free dance <br>
                    Free dance <br>
                    We gonna brake you down <br>
                    Are you ready? <br>
                    The fakers <br>
                    Are all sick at heart <br>
                    Their faces hiding their fear <br>
                    They look down on <br>
                    All the rest of us <br>
                    Like they're some special breed <br>
                    Who's the high lord <br>
                    Who thinks he's better than us? <br>
                    Ain't it a crime, that? <br>
                    Is there a mission for us? <br>
                    Who is that high lord? <br>
                    Who'd kill a million of us? <br>
                    And as the bell tolls <br>
                    Is there no remission for us? <br>
                    Wake up, get up, get out there <br>
                    There's more to life than their way <br>
                    If you'd live you cannot stay <br>
                    Why does nobody want change? <br>
                    Let your voices ring out, yeah <br>
                    Take the mask off and be free <br>
                    Find yourself in the debris <br>
                    If you hold on life won't change <br>
                    Wake up, get up, get out there <br>
                    Raise your voice against liars <br>
                    Feed your anger like fire <br>
                    Why does nobody want change? <br>
                    Just imagine you're out there <br>
                    Swatting lies in the making <br>
                    Can't move fast without breaking <br>
                    If you hold on life won't change <br>
